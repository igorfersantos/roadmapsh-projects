# Task Tracker CLI App

Task Tracker CLI App built to practice Java coding. 

[Roadmap.sh's Task Tracker CLI project details](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

## Note  

The only constraint I broke was "Do not use any external libraries or frameworks to build this project."
and for a good reason, as Java doesnt have a native API to interact with Json files. 

Making a small library only for doing this task would be another project by itself
and I didn't feel doing it at the moment. I was more concerned on doing what the project proposed.

I will consider doing it next as a challenge project though.

Also, I used JUnit for testing, and I don't think that using JUnit for testing break this rule, right?
